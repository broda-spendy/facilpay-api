# Settlements & Payout Scheduling

## Overview

The settlements module lets merchants configure a payout schedule and view settlement history. FacilPay automatically batches completed payments into settlement records on a configurable frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly). Each settlement groups payments by merchant and currency, records the total amount, and links back to the individual payment IDs included in the batch.

Settlement processing is driven by cron jobs that run in the background. Merchants can also be triggered manually by an administrator for ad-hoc settlement runs.

## Configuration

### Schedule Frequencies

| Schedule  | Cron Expression      | Runs                         |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `daily`   | `0 0 * * *`          | Every day at midnight (UTC)  |
| `weekly`  | `0 0 * * 0`          | Every Sunday at midnight     |
| `monthly` | `0 0 1 * *`          | 1st of every month at midnight|

### Gross vs. Net Amounts

By default, settlements are calculated on the **net amount** (payment amount minus platform fees). To settle on the **gross amount** (the full payment amount before fees), set the `SETTLEMENT_USE_GROSS_AMOUNT` environment variable to `true`:

```
SETTLEMENT_USE_GROSS_AMOUNT=true
```

When calculating the settlement total, each completed payment's settled amount is:

- **Gross mode** (`SETTLEMENT_USE_GROSS_AMOUNT=true`): `payment.amount`
- **Net mode** (default): `payment.netAmount` (falls back to `payment.amount` if `netAmount` is not set)

## Endpoints

All settlement endpoints require a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

### Manually Trigger Settlement Run (Admin)

```
POST /v1/admin/settlements/run
```

Triggers an out-of-band settlement run for **all** merchants with a configured settlement schedule, independent of the regular cron schedule. This processes every merchant that has pending completed payments since their last settlement.

**Response — `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "settlementsCreated": 2,
  "totalAmount": 3147.25,
  "settlements": [
    {
      "id": "new-settlement-1",
      "merchantId": "merchant-uuid-1",
      "schedule": "weekly",
      "totalAmount": 1523.75,
      "currency": "USD",
      "paymentIds": ["pay-1", "pay-2"],
      "processedAt": "2026-07-21T12:00:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "new-settlement-2",
      "merchantId": "merchant-uuid-2",
      "schedule": "monthly",
      "totalAmount": 1623.50,
      "currency": "EUR",
      "paymentIds": ["pay-3"],
      "processedAt": "2026-07-21T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** Merchants with no pending completed payments since their last settlement are skipped — no empty settlements are created.

**Error Responses**

| Status | Condition                  |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| `401`  | Missing or invalid JWT     |
| `403`  | Admin role required        |

## How Settlement Processing Works

### Selection Criteria

When a settlement runs (either by cron or manual trigger), the system:

1. Finds all merchant settlement configs matching the triggered schedule.
2. For each config, queries for payments where:
   - `status = COMPLETED`
   - `merchantId` matches the config owner
   - `currency` matches the config currency
   - `updatedAt > lastSettledAt` (or all completed payments if `lastSettledAt` is null)
3. If no matching payments exist, the merchant is skipped for this run.

### Settlement Creation

For each merchant with pending payments:

1. Sums the payment amounts (gross or net, based on `SETTLEMENT_USE_GROSS_AMOUNT`).
2. Creates a `Settlement` record with the total amount, currency, and linked payment IDs.
3. Updates all included payments with the `settlementId` reference.
4. Updates `lastSettledAt` on the merchant's config to the current timestamp.
5. Sends a settlement notification email to the merchant.

### Refund Adjustments

When a payment that has already been settled is later refunded, a `SettlementAdjustment` record is created on the original settlement. The adjustment stores the refund amount as a negative value, allowing the merchant to reconcile post-settlement refunds against their settlement history.

### Cron Schedules

The following cron jobs run automatically:

| Schedule  | Cron Expression | Method                     |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Daily     | `0 0 * * *`     | `runDailySettlements()`    |
| Weekly    | `0 0 * * 0`     | `runWeeklySettlements()`   |
| Monthly   | `0 0 1 * *`     | `runMonthlySettlements()`  |

Each cron job processes only merchants whose config matches that schedule frequency. Multiple schedules can overlap — a merchant with a `daily` config will be processed by the daily cron, while a merchant with a `monthly` config is only processed on the 1st of each month.

## Authentication & Permissions

| Endpoint                              | Method | Auth Required | Role       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| `POST /v1/settlements/config`         | Yes    | Yes           | Any (merchant configures own) |
| `GET /v1/settlements`                 | Yes    | Yes           | Any (returns own settlements) |
| `GET /v1/settlements/:id/adjustments` | Yes    | Yes           | Any (returns own adjustments) |
| `GET /v1/admin/settlements`           | Yes    | Yes           | **ADMIN**  |
| `POST /v1/admin/settlements/run`      | Yes    | Yes           | **ADMIN**  |

Ownership is enforced at the service layer — merchants can only access their own settlement data. The admin endpoints bypass merchant filtering and require the `ADMIN` role.
